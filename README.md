# SomethingNew
Hexdump G function based on Numerical encoding for usage in PTSD EncryptionPlot

usage: python3 try.py #number | (wsl here if not on linux) hexdump

Then copy the hex output, paste it down and remove the enter spacing, and enter it into encryptionplot.py via

python3 encryptionplot.py "hexdump output"

Then you can use the Plot for artwork, or see if the G brings some theories around leaving it open.
